I like to go on rabbit holes for pretty much everything. 

This GitHub page is a memorial for all my dead and abandoned projects. And the one project being made that will someday be covered in cobwebs. Rest in pieces and lots of unfixed bugs <3.

Y'all I think I went down the webdev rabbit hole a bit too much...

## Interests

I used to make Discord bots with Python, which I learned via an online course during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently, I explored making static websites with vanilla HTML/CSS and static site generators such as Lume and Hugo.

I'd like to learn other languages in the future. Thinking about learning JavaScript, Java or C.

Currently trying to find out what to do with a Raspberry Pi. I'd like to study cyber security in the future, but networking is one hell of a topic.
