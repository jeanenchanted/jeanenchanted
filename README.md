- 👋 Heyo, I’m **@jeanenchanted**. You can just call me **Jean**.
- 👀 I’m interested in **JavaScript** and making some cool **websites**. Mostly, I like to make **Discord bots**, especially with **DBD.js**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **JavaScript** on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), so that I could make better apps.
- 📚 Aside from coding, I also love **reading** and **writing** as well as listening to **Taylor Swift** - and making fan theories, of course!
- 🔰 I'm currently a **Swiftie/Potterhead**.
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me on my **[Discord](https://dsc.gg/jean)** server.
