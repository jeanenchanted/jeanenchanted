- ðŸ‘‹ Heyo, Iâ€™m @jeanenchanted. You can just call me Jean.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in JavaScript and making some cool websites. Mostly, I like to make Discord bots, especially with DBD.js.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), so that I could make better apps.
- ðŸ“š  Aside from coding, I also love reading and writing as well as listening to Taylor Swift - and making fan theories, of course!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by messaging me on my [Discord](https://dsc.gg/jean).
